**[Experiment] Suggest the Workspaces add-on to accounts that use multiple template types**

:question: **Why We Built It**
We are exploring ways to recommend relevant features to customers based on their specific use cases. We know that the Workspaces add-on is used in various ways, with some customers leveraging it to organize work across multiple teams, departments, or even separate businesses. By this experiment we want to validate that customers who have templates from different use cases (Sales and HR) might benefit from using Workspaces add-on.

:bulb: **Hypothesis**
If we target customers who have a single workspace but multiple template types (e.g., Sales invoices + HR contracts) and suggest the Workspaces add-on, then these customers are more likely to start a trial of add-on, find value in diversifying their work, and as a result will convert to a purchase.

:gear: **How It Works**

* Experiment relevant only to active and past due Business plan accounts who never started trial of Workspaces add-on before  
* Customers will see an inline suggestion that can be expanded into a hero card within the Document Lister, and they will have the option to dismiss it.  
* Main CTA will start the 7-day Workspaces add-on trial

:bar_chart: **Objectives**

* Validating the hypothesis of targeted suggestion of certain add-ons  
* Increase number of customers trying Workspaces add-on  
* Add-on expansion MRR as a result of purchasing add-on after add-on trial

:date: **Experiment details**

* Split name **exp_growth_experiment_workspaces_for_different_templates**  
* 17 November - 100% rollout to Business accounts that fall into experiment logic  
* Live for 30 days, followed by data analysis afterwards
